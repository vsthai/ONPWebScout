# ONPWebScout

Automatic tool for scraping oral nicotine pouch (ONP) brand data. Our pipeline first performs a Google Search to find retailer websites, then uses ChatGPT to determine which results are stores and extract the brands they carry. Finally, results are consolidated and duplicates removed.

## Features

- Monitors ONP brands across the web
- Automatically detects brands using LLMs
- Consolidates and cleans scraped data

## Folder Structure

Our pipeline consists of 3 stages: web search, LLM evaluation, and result consolidation. These are located in the `stages/` directory.

We also use a modified version of two class from [ScrapeGraphAI](https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/Scrapegraph-ai), licensed under the MIT license. The adapted code and the license text are in the `scrapegraphAI_extension/` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- List of Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`
